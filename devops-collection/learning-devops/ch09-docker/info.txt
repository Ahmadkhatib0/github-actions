# The az cli script that creates a resource group and an ACR resource is shown here:

az group create --name RG-ACR --location eastus
az acr create --resource-group RG-ACR --name acrdemo --sku Basic

az login
az acr login --name demobookacr


# For pushing a Docker image into this ACR resource, we will execute a couple of commands.
# The first command is to create a tag to the local image:
docker tag demobook:v1 demobookacr.azurecr.io/demobook:v1

# The second command is to push the image into the ACR resource:
docker push demobookacr.azurecr.io/demobook:v1

# to pull this image: 
docker pull demobookacr.azurecr.io/demobook:v1
