-- Once continuous integration has been completed, the next step is to deploy the application automatically in 
   one or more non-production environments, which is called staging. This process is called continuous delivery (CD).

-- CD often starts with an application package being prepared by CI, which will be installed 
   based on a list of automated tasks. These tasks can be of any type: unzip, stop and restart 
   service, copy files, replace configuration, and so on. The execution of functional and
   acceptance tests can also be performed during the CD process.

-- Provisioning is the act of instantiating the resources that make up the infrastructure. They
    can be of the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and serverless resource types, such as a web
    app, Azure function, or Event Hub, but also the entire network part that is managed, such
    as VNet, subnets, routing tables, or Azure Firewall. For virtual machine resources, the
    provisioning step only creates or updates the VM cloud resource, but not its content.
