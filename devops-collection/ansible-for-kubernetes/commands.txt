# Creating a new Ansible Vault is very straightforward:
$ ansible-vault create secret.yml
# You can use Ansible Vault in any Ansible Playbook by specifying the --vault-id@prompt parameter 
  in the command line.

# init a role called role-example in the current roles dir
$ ansible-galaxy role init role-example

# You can execute your requirements.yml role file using this ansible-galaxy command:
$ ansible-galaxy role install -r roles/requirements.yml
• role install parameter, which installs a role
• -r specifies the usage of the requirements.yml file under the roles directory

 installs the latest version of the community.general Ansible collection
$ ansible-galaxy collection install community.general

# execute the requirements.yml collection file (install multiple collections):
$ ansible-galaxy collection install -r collections/requirements.yml

# build the my_ee execuation environment 
$ ansible-builder build -t my_ee -v 3

# After executing the ansible-builder tool, you obtain the context directory with all the building 
  instructions and the my_ee container to execute your Ansible code. Once the container has been 
  built, you can execute your Ansible Playbook inside the Ansible Execution Environment using 
  the ansible-runner command: 

$ sudo dnf install ansible-runner # or: 
$ pip install ansible-runner

$ ansible-runner run -p ping.yml --inventory inventory --container-­image=my_ee .
