# dependency: This is a Terragrunt feature that can be used to automatically read the output vari‚Äê
# ables of another Terragrunt module, so you can pass them as input variables to the
# current module, as follows:  mysql_config = dependency.mysql.outputs
#
# In other words, dependency blocks are an alternative to using terraform_remote_state data sources to pass 
# data between modules. While terra form_remote_state data sources have the advantage of being native to Terraform,
# the drawback is that they make your modules more tightly coupled together, as each module needs to know how other 
# modules store state. Using Terragrunt dependency blocks allows your modules to expose generic inputs like 
# mysql_config and vpc_id, instead of using data sources, which makes the modules less tightly coupled and
# easier to test and reuse.
