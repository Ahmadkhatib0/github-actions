Providers should be configured only in root modules and not in reusable modules 

When creating modules, watch out for these gotchas:
• File paths
• Inline blocks

By default, Terraform interprets the path relative to the current working directory.
  That works if you’re using the templatefile function in a Terraform configuration
  file that’s in the same directory as where you’re running terraform apply (that is,
  if you’re using the templatefile function in the root module), but that won’t work
  when you’re using templatefile in a module that’s defined in a separate folder (a reusable module).

Terraform supports the following types of path references:

path.module
  Returns the filesystem path of the module where the expression is defined.
  
path.root
  Returns the filesystem path of the root module.
  
path.cwd
  Returns the filesystem path of the current working directory. In normal use of Terraform, this is 
  the same as path.root, but some advanced uses of Terraform run it from a dire

By versioning your modules, you can use different versions in different
  environments: e.g., v0.0.1 in prod and v0.0.2 in stage,


modules
  This repo defines reusable modules. Think of each module as a “blueprint” that
  defines a specific part of your infrastructure.
live
  This repo defines the live infrastructure you’re running in each environment (stage, prod, mgmt, etc.). 
  Think of this as the “houses” you built from the “blueprints” in the modules repo.
