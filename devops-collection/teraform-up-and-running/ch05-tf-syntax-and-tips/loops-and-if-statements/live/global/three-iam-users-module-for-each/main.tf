# Note the use of toset to convert the var.user_names list into a set. This is because
# for_each supports sets and maps only when used on a resource. When for_each loops over this 
# set, it makes each username available in each.value. The username will also be available in 
# each.key, though you typically use each.key only with maps of key-value pairs.
#
# Once youâ€™ve used for_each on a resource, it becomes a map of resources, rather
# than just one resource (or an array of resources as with count).
