If you don’t want to deal with an interactive prompt, you can provide a 
  value for the variable via the -var command-line option:
$ terraform plan -var "server_port=8080"

# see the value of output vars, or a specific variable
$ terraform output [ OUTPUT_NAME ] 


$ terraform workspace show

$ terraform workspace new example1

# if you do: teraform plan:  you will see that Terraform wants to create a totally new EC2 
  Instance from scratch! That’s because the state files in each workspace are isolated from 
  one another, and because you’re now in the example1 workspace, (so this is the workspace isloation level)

$ terraform workspace list

# switch to another workspace
$ terraform workspace select example1


# the Terraform console is read-only, so you don’t need to worry about accidentally changing infrastructure or state.
$ terraform console 
# > format("%.3f", 3.14159265359)             =>>>          3.142
