Troubleshooting
  You might hit a few speed bumps when trying to run this playbook on your local machine. This 
  section describes how to overcome some common obstacles. 
  
Cannot Check Out Git Repository
  You may see the task named “check out the repository on the host” fail with this error:
  fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
  A likely fix is to remove a preexisting entry for 192.168.33.10 in your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file.

Cannot Reach 192.168.33.10.nip.io
  Some WiFi routers ship with DNS servers that won’t resolve the hostname 192.168.33.10.nip.io. 
  You can check whether yours does by typing the following on the command line:
  $ dig +short 192.168.33.10.nip.io
  The output should be as follows: 192.168.33.10
  If the output is blank, your DNS server is refusing to resolve nip.io hostnames. If this
  is the case, a workaround is to add the following to your /etc/hosts file:
  192.168.33.10 192.168.33.10.nip.io

Bad Request (400)
  If your browser returns the error “Bad Request (400),” it is likely that you are trying
  to reach the Mezzanine site by using a hostname or IP address that is not in the
  ALLOWED_HOSTS list in the Mezzanine configuration file. This list is populated using
  the domains Ansible variable in the playbook:
  domains:
  - 192.168.33.10.nip.io
  - www.192.168.33.10.nip.io
