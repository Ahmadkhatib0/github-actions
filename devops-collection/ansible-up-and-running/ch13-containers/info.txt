Ansible and Docker
  When you use Ansible to create container images and start the containers on the
  remote hosts, the application life cycle looks like this:
1. Write Ansible playbooks for creating container images.
2. Run the playbooks to create container images on your local machine.
3. Push container images up from your local machine to the registry.
4. Write Ansible playbooks to pull container images down to remote hosts and run
   them, passing in configuration information.
5. Run Ansible playbooks to start up the containers.
