Reorganize the Ansible content into three parts:
  • Core components, created by the Ansible team
  • Certified content, created by Red Hat’s business partners
  • Community content, created by thousands of enthusiasts worldwide


Where Should I Put My ansible.cfg File?
Ansible looks for an ansible.cfg file in the following places, in this order:
  • File specified by the ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable
  • ./ansible.cfg (ansible.cfg in the current directory)
  • ~/.ansible.cfg (.ansible.cfg in your home directory)
  • /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg (Linux) or /usr/local/etc/ansible/ansi‐ble.cfg (*BSD)


Ansible uses /etc/ansible/hosts as the default location for the inventory file. 
Keeping the inventory in the same directory as the play‐ books and so on gives you 
the possibility of a specific inventory per project instead of just a global one.
