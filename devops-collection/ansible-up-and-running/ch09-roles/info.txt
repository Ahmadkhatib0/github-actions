Basic Structure of a Role Directory

Tasks
  The tasks directory has a main.yml file that serves as an entry point for the actions a role does.

Files
  Holds files and scripts to be uploaded to hosts.

Templates
  Holds Jinja2 template files to be uploaded to hosts.

Handlers
  The handlers directory has a main.yml file that has the actions that respond to
  change notifications.
  
Vars
  Variables that shouldn’t generally be overridden.

Defaults
  Default variables that can be overridden.

Meta
  Information about the role.


Where Does Ansible Look for My Roles?
  Ansible looks for roles in the roles directory alongside your playbooks. It also looks
  for systemwide roles in /etc/ansible/roles. You can customize the systemwide location
  of roles by setting the roles_path setting in the defaults section of your ansible.cfg file,


Our database role is comprised of the following files:
•••  roles/database/defaults/main.yml
•••  roles/database/files/pg_hba.conf
•••  roles/database/handlers/main.yml
•••  roles/database/meta/main.yml
•••  roles/database/tasks/main.yml
•••  roles/database/templates/postgresql.conf.j2
•••  roles/database/vars/main.yml

This role includes two customized Postgres configuration files:
postgresql.conf.j2
  Modifies the default listen_addresses configuration option so that Postgres will
  accept connections on any network interface. The default for Postgres is to accept
  connections only from localhost, which doesn’t work for us if we want our
  database to run on a separate host from our web application.
  
pg_hba.conf
  Configures Postgres to authenticate connections over the network by using a
  username and password.

  
There’s one important caveat when it comes to using the copy, script, or template
  modules. There is a difference between tasks defined in a role and tasks defined in a
  regular playbook. When invoking copy or script in a task defined in a role, Ansible
  will look in this order in these directories for the location of the file to copy or run
  and will use the first one found. These paths are relative to the directory where you
  start the top-level playbook from.
  
••• ./roles/role_name/files/
••• ./roles/role_name/
••• ./roles/role_name/tasks/files/
••• ./roles/role_name/tasks/
••• ./files/
••• ./
