## Jenkins Configuration As Code
#

jobs:
  - file: /var/lib/jenkins/jobs.groovy

# For a complex pluggable automation system like Jenkins, you should rather use a
# minimal amount of Ansible, to have it manage itself. The plug-in configuration-as-
# code (casc) uses a YAML file to configure different parts of the Jenkins setup.
# Jenkins can install some tools itself given this YAML config file, which we install with
# the template module as follows:

tool:
  ansibleInstallation:
    installations:
    - home: "/usr/local/bin"
      name: "ansible"
  git:
    installations:
    - home: "git"
      name: "Default"
