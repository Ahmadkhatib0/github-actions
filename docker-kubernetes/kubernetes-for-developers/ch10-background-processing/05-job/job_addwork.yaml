# how many times to try and run the Job. This encompasses both crashes, but also node failures.
# For example, if you set this value to 6, and the Job crashes twice on a node, then that node is
# removed, the Job controller will reschedule the Pod elsewhere and try it 4 more times. Some practitioners
# like to use Never when debugging as itâ€™s easier to see all the failed Pods and query their logs.
