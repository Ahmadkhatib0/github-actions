# The headless services for this StatefulSet (required)
# NOTE: the headless service  means that unlike every other Service we created so far there is no service
# endpoint with load balancing. The service has no IP, external or internal. It exists so that the pods in
# the StatefulSet can get their own network identities so that they can be addressed. Remember that each pod
# in the stateful set is unique (unlike with Deployments), and is given an incrementing integer value known as
# the ordinal, so itâ€™s common to address them individually and directly. This is opposed to Pods in a
# Deployment where each pod is given a random id. If a Pod in a Stateful set is recreated (like when moved
# from one node to another during an update) it will retain the same identifying ordinal, whereas Pods that
# are replaced in a Deployment are assigned a new random name.
#
# Pods can be addressed at STATEFULSET_NAME-POD_ORDINAL.SERVICE_NAME
# In this example, our single pod can be referenced using the DNS address: mariadb-
# 0.mariadb-service. From outside the namespace, you can append the namespace e.g.:
# mariadb-0-mariadb-service.production.svc
