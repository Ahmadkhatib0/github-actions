#
#
# The ReadWriteOnce access mode is for a volume that
# behaves like a traditional hard drive where your storage is mounted to a single pod for read
# write access and is the most common. The other choices for accessMode are ReadOnlyMany
# which can be used to mount a volume of existing data thatâ€™s shared across many pods, and
# ReadWriteMany for mounting file storage (like NFS) where multiple pods can read/write at the
# same time (a fairly special mode, only supported by a few storage drivers)
