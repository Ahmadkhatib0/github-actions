# The toleration wonâ€™t cause the Pod only to be scheduled on the tainted node; it only allows
# it to be. Where the Pod is scheduled will be determined based on a few other factors, like
# available capacity. Thus, Pods with the toleration can land on untainted nodes, as well as nodes
# with taints that they tolerate
