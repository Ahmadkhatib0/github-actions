instead of =>  mongodb://localhost:27017/swfavorites
mongodb://host.docker.internal:27017/swfavorites  
//host.docker.internal this is understood by docker and it will be translated to the url of
//the local host machine das seen inside the container (note you can to have http instead 
//of mongodb ) and this is for commination between your dockerized apps and your local host machine 

mongodb://172.17.0.3:27017/swfavorites
//172.17.0.3 is ip of the mongodb container, got by inspect this container 
//this way we communicate with another container 

//the previous way is not the easiest way, we need to lookup for network ip for each container 
//so the solution is to create DOCKER NETWORK,which will automatically resolve the names for 
//all containers within this network , first unless volumes which are created automatically 
//you need to create a network with a name of you choice
docker network create favorites-net 
docker run -d --name mongodb mongo --network favorites-net mongo
docker run -p 3000:3000 --name favorites -d --rm --network favorites-net favorites
// mongodb://172.17.0.3:27017/swfavorites => mongodb://mongodb:27017/swfavorites
//as with host.docker.internal , by putting the name of the container docker will 
//resolve its ip automatically,without warring about looking up for its ip 

//important note: when working with mongo if you changed the credentials for a db an user name 
//you need to remove the old volumes and then create them, because the old credentials will 
//still be locked inside them 

RUN npm install \ COPY . . 
//note: the node_modules will be copied from the local hard to the container because of 
//this . . which copies everything again into the container including node_modules
//the solution is simple, exclude them in .dockerignore file
