$ k create deployment echo --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/echoserver:2.5

# To expose our (created) pod as a service, type the following:
$ k expose deployment echo --type=NodePort --port=8080


# Exposing the service as type NodePort means that it is exposed to the host on some port. 
# But it is not the 8080 port we ran the pod on. Ports get mapped in the cluster. To access 
# the service, we need the cluster IP and exposed port:
$ minikube ip     # 172.26.246.89

# then 
$ k get service echo -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}'   # 32649

# then access the echo service, which returns a lot of information:
$ curl http://172.26.246.89:32649/hi




# create cluster using kind config file
kind create cluster --config kind-ha-multi-node-config.yaml --kubeconfig $TMPDIR/kind-ha-multi-node-config

# after creating we'll get 3-node cluster 
$ k get nodes --kubeconfig $TMPDIR/kind-ha-multi-node-config

# KinD has its own get nodes command, where you can see the load balancer:
$ kind get nodes --name ha-multi-node-cluster

# deploy our echo service on the KinD cluster: 
$ k create deployment echo --image=g1g1/echo-server:0.1 --kubeconfig $TMPDIR/kind-ha-multi-node-config

# expose 
$ k expose deployment echo --type=NodePort --port=7070 --kubeconfig $TMPDIR/kind-ha-multi-node-config

# check the exposed service (external ip won't be shown, so complete the upcomming steps)
$ k get svc echo --kubeconfig $TMPDIR/kind-ha-multi-node-config 


# Accessing Kubernetes services locally through a proxy

# First, we need to run the kubectl proxy command that exposes the API server, pods, and services on localhost:
$ k proxy --kubeconfig $TMPDIR/kind-ha-multi-node-config &

# Then, we can access the echo service through a specially crafted proxy URL that includes 
# the exposed port (8080) and NOT the node port:
$ http http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/echo:7070/proxy/yeah-it-works
