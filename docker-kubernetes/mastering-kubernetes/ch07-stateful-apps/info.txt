Utilizing StatefulSet
  StatefulSets are specially designed to support distributed stateful applications where the identities of the 
  members are important, and if a pod is restarted, it must retain its identity in the set. It provides ordered 
  deployment and scaling. Unlike regular pods, the pods of a StatefulSet are associated with persistent storage.

When to use StatefulSet
StatefulSets are great for applications that necessitate any of the following capabilities:
 • •  Consistent and distinct network identifiers
 • •  Persistent and enduring storage
 • •  Methodical and orderly deployment and scaling
 • •  Systematic and organized deletion and termination


Digging into the Cassandra configuration file
  There are two settings that are particularly relevant: the seed provider and the snitch. The seed pro-
  vider is responsible for publishing a list of IP addresses (seeds) for nodes in the cluster. Each node that
  starts running connects to the seeds (there are usually at least three) and if it successfully reaches one
  of them, they immediately exchange information about all the nodes in the cluster. This information
  is updated constantly for each node as the nodes gossip with each other.
