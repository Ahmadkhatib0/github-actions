# Pods consume raw block volumes as devices under /dev and NOT as mounted filesystems. Containers can then
# access these devices and read/write to them. In practice this means that I/O requests to block storage go
# directly to the underlying block storage and donâ€™t pass through the file system drivers. This is in theory
# faster, but in practice it can actually decrease performance if your application benefits from file
# system buffering.
